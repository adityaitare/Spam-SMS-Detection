# Spam-SMS-Detection
This project focuses on detecting and classifying SMS messages as Spam or Ham (non-spam) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.
It applies text preprocessing, feature extraction, and supervised learning algorithms to build a robust spam classifier.

ðŸš€ Features
ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing & Cleaning â€“ Removed noise, punctuation, stopwords, and unnecessary characters

âœ¨ Feature Extraction â€“ Used TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert text into numerical features

ðŸ¤– Model Training â€“ Implemented Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)

ðŸ“Š Data Visualization â€“ Spam vs Ham distribution using Matplotlib & Seaborn

ðŸ“ˆ Model Evaluation â€“ Accuracy Score & Confusion Matrix for performance measurement

ðŸ”® Custom Prediction Function â€“ Predict spam status for new/unseen messages

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
