# Spam-SMS-Detection
This project implements a machine learning-based classifier to detect and classify SMS messages as Spam or Ham (non-spam). The goal is to automate spam filtering and improve communication safety.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing & Text Cleaning – Removed noise, stopwords, and unnecessary characters

Feature Extraction – Used TF-IDF Vectorizer to transform text into numerical features

Model Training – Implemented Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM for classification

Model Evaluation – Measured performance using Accuracy Score & Confusion Matrix

Custom Prediction Function – Allows classification of new/unseen SMS messages

Data Visualization – Plotted spam vs ham distribution using Matplotlib & Seaborn

Tech Stack:
Python | Pandas | scikit-learn | NLTK | Matplotlib | Seaborn

Outcome: Achieved high accuracy in spam classification and gained deeper understanding of text preprocessing, vectorization techniques, and model evaluation
